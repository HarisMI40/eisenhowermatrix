## Overview

The Eisenhower Matrix (also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix) is a productivity and decision-making tool that helps you organize tasks based on their urgency and importance. The matrix divides tasks into four quadrants:

1. **Do** (Urgent & Important)
   - Tasks that need immediate attention
   - Crisis management
   - Deadline-driven projects

2. **Schedule** (Not Urgent & Important)
   - Strategic planning
   - Personal development
   - Long-term goals

3. **Delegate** (Urgent & Not Important)
   - Interruptions
   - Some meetings
   - Some emails

4. **Eliminate** (Not Urgent & Not Important)
   - Time wasters
   - Some emails
   - Unproductive activities
